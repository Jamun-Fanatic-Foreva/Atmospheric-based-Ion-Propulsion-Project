### Atmospheric-based Ion Propulsion Project

This repository contains the files necessary to replicate the research of *Chen, She, et al. (2019)* which simulates an electroaerodynamic driven aeroplane using an emitter and collector set-up in COMSOL.
We aim to reproduce the same, using _AnsysÂ® Fluent, 2020R2, ANSYS, Inc_
